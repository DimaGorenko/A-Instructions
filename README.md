# A-Instructions
A-Instructions was created on freelance. A simple adaptive cross-browser site with instructions for the manual and operation of the client's product. For the icons, I used the SVG format, layout on pure HTML and CSS, without assemblers, preprocessors or frameworks, because this is one of my first works and simply because the site is as simple as possible.
